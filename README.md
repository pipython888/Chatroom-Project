# Chatroom Project
A Basic Chatroom that is getting more advanced.

This is a text-based interface, and it is coded in Python.

This is a simple (but getting more complex) chatroom that supports a ton of awesome stuff, for instance:

+ Safe-ish accounts (uses the Vigenere cipher to keep passwords safe-ish)
+ Easily create accounts
+ Get social with your buddies really easily
+ Saves data offline on a `data.json` file

This project is getting more advanced every day! The owner is constantly adding more features every day! :tada:

I hope you enjoy the project!
